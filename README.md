In memory Indexing with availability lists

The program supports functions such as:

ADD key_rec: adds key_record to the file

FIND key: find and retrieves the record

DEL key: deletes the record

END: persistently stores indexes and availability lists to disk 

If an index already exists, the program reads from it and recreates its indices and availability lists.
